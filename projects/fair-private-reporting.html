<h3>Purpose of the Study</h3>
<div>
    This study aims to design a more effective reporting system that respects individual privacy and ensures due process. 
</div>

<h3>Study Procedures</h3>
<div>
    In the one-hour interview, participants will share their experiences with the reporting system within online communities, 
    <br/> as well as their opinions on various proposed designs for reporting systems.
</div>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<div>You may learn more about reporting systems in online communities and get an opportunity to inform the design of future reporting mechanisms with their own testimonies.</div>

<h3>Risks</h3>
<div>
    We foresee extremely minimal risks with this study. 
    <br/> While harassment scenarios may include offensive languages, we design intricate study procedures to prevent any unnecessary exposure and harms. 
<div>

<h3>Protecting Your Information</h3>
<div>
    The interview can be conducted using a video conferencing tool or audio call. 
    <br/>If participants choose video or audio chats, the interview will be recorded but for internal purposes only. 
    We will also keep your identity anonymous.
</div>

<h3>Compensation</h3>
<div>If selected participants are willing to share their email address and name, they will receive a $20 Amazon gift card.</div>
