<h3>Purpose of the Study</h3>
<div>This study aims to understand through interviews how users' privacy concerns might shape their decisions to report harassment and hate speech on encrypted messaging platforms (i.e. WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messengers etc.).</div>

<h3>Study Procedures</h3>
<div>During the one-hour interview, we will invite participants to consider a series of harassment scenarios and hear their understanding about how reporting works on encrypted messaging platforms as well as their privacy concerns. </div>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<div>You may learn more about reporting on encrpyted messaging platforms.</div>

<h3>Risks</h3>
<div>We foresee extremely minimal risks with this study. While harassment examples may include offensive languages, we encourage participants to skip examples that they find disturbing. Additionally, all interviewed participants are anonymous and no identifiable information is collected.</div>

<h3>Protecting Your Information</h3>
<div>We are collecting no identifiable information about the individual interviewed. We also provide a variety of communication channels including emails, encrypted messsaging platforms or online meeting softwares and participants are welcome to choose the one they prefer.</div>

<h3>Compensation</h3>
<div>Participants will receive a $20 Amazon gift card.</div>
